```

## 🚧 Challenges & Future Improvements

### Current Challenges

1. **Scalability of Rule-Based System**
   - As product catalog grows, rule evaluation becomes slower
   - **Solution**: Implement caching layer with Redis for frequently accessed recommendations

2. **Cold Start for New Users**
   - Limited data for new users results in generic recommendations
   - **Solution**: Use collaborative filtering based on similar user segments

3. **Real-Time Performance**
   - Complex rule evaluation can cause delays
   - **Solution**: Pre-compute recommendations and refresh periodically
